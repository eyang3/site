By training, a computational biologist, professionally a data scientist, make-shift statistician, and software developer working in the Pharmaceutical Industry. However, more specifically, I'm the person you call when you have a pile of data and don't know what to do with it. Basically I specialize in looking at data, figuring out what interesting questions it can answer, and then creating applications/visualizations to convey the results to a wider audience.

My two contributions to science that I'm most proud of:
1. [Cytoskeleton-based forecasting of stem cell lineage fates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818905/)
2. [Quantifying the pathophysiological timeline of Alzheimer's disease.](/files/Quantifying.pdf)
